If they are not cooked, then add about ½ cup water again and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles more.The urad dal should melt in the mouth and should not give any bite or resistance when eaten. You can also just mash the urad dal with a spoon or with your fingers to check the doneness. The same rule applies for rajma too. Keep the cooked beans aside.In a blender or mixer jar, take chopped tomatoes and blend to a smooth puree. Set aside.You can also add ready 1 cup tomato puree instead of blending the tomatoes.

Do keep on stirring at intervals.When the gravy has thickened enough, then add cream. Dal makhani is not too thick or too thin. It has a medium consistency.Mix the cream very well. Then switch off the heat.Mix the cream very well. Then switch off the heat.Add crushed kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves).
